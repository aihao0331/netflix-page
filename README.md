# netflix-page
Coding Assignment

//The task is to create a mock Netflix like page with editable rows of titles using any framework you want (preferably React).

//You are given the following JSON object which will serve as mock back end data: 

// The top row will be the ‘My List’ row and will display the titles included in ‘mylist’ array. The
// second row will be the recommendation row which will display the titles included in
// ‘recommendations’ array.

// Hovering over an image in the ‘My List’ row should create a “Remove” button displayed below
// the image. Clicking on the button should remove the title from the “My List” row.
// Hovering over an image in the recommendations row should create an “Add” button displayed
// below the image. Clicking on the button should add the title to the “My List” row.
// The list of titles in the “My List” row should be displayed at the bottom of the page.
